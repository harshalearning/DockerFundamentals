The goal is to create a simple project with 2 containers, having 2 technologies and merge the containers into 1. So that world can interact and so we could work on them.

In this scenario we don't work with Docker. We will use Docker compose (use .yaml file).

Strategy:

We will create a application with (app(node) + DB(mongo db)). ondifferent containers and wrap them into 1 with docker compose.
